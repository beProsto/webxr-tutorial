# Experimenting with lighting

## This article will be a kind of an experiment itself. I wanna get a little funky with lighting before we go onto something as important as 3D sound (because yes - that's what I'm planning for the next episode).

Let's start with creating a directional light. If you don't know what that is - it's a light that shines equally from the same direction on all of the objects in the scene. We can call it the video game's equivalent of sun.

So how does one go about doing this whole directional lighting thing?
