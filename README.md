# webxr-tutorial
A simple, brief WebXR tutorial for VR purposes.

This project is a github pages website that strives to be a starting point for learning WebXR

Throughout this course we go from a blank webpage to a working VR web application.

The tutorial, as an addition, features a brief guide to 3D sounds with `web audio` and `resonance`. 

It also features a comment functionality! 

I hope you like it. :D
